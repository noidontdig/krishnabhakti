<p><b>What is a Krishna Bhakti?</b><br>
"Bhakti" means "devotion" and "krishna" means "the all attractive one" so "Krishna Bhakti" means "devotion to God."  These are the hare krishnas that we've all come to know and love.</p>

<a name="2" id="2"></a>
<p><b>Do I have to be Hindu and/or vegetarian to come to the cooking classes?</b><br>
Yep.</p>

<a name="3" id="3"></a>
<p><b>How much do the classes cost?</b><br>
Nothing.  The Krishna Bhakti Club is an official NYU club which means we get official NYU funding for our events, so the food at the vegetarian cooking classes is free, as are the refreshments served during the Bhagavad Gita study group session.</p>

<a name="4" id="4"></a>
<p><b>Who teaches the classes?</b><br>
Both are taught by Radha, a volunteer monk. Be careful not to look him in the eye.</p>

<a name="5" id="5"></a>
<p><b>Is this a trick to steal my soul from Judaeo-Christianity?</b><br>
Just like the truths that all uncles are pedophiles, all lesbians secretely want a man and that those small children from Taiwan like 16 hour work days and infectious diseases. The only purpose is to promote a vegetarian diet and expand your horizons beyond meat.</p>

<a name="6" id="6"></a>
<p><b>No garlic or onions?  What's up with that?</b><br>
They're satanic. But really, the Vedas say (somewhere in there) that garlic and onion are aphrodisiacs which inflame one's passions. If you weren't too chicken to eat a whole bulb of garlic at once you'd know this is true. But the food still tastes mmm-Krishna-good.</p>

<a name="7" id="7"></a>
<p><b>Is the food vegan?  There's no revolution like a half revolution.</b><br>
The food we make is vegetarian.  Small steps.  Most of the people here have NOT seen Meet Your Meat.</p>
