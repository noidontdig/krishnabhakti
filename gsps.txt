DAL SOAKING TIME: 5 hours
PREPARATION TIME: 10 minutes
COOKING TIME: 1 hour

YIELD: enough for 4 - 6 persons

1 cup (250 ml) green split peas
1 teaspoon (5 ml) minced fresh ginger
1 small hot green chili, seeded and minced
6 cups (11/2 litres) water
1 teaspoon (5 ml) turmeric
2 teaspoons (10 ml) ground coriander
1 small bunch spinach, washed thoroughly and roughly chopped
11/2 teaspoons (7 ml) salt
1 cup (250 ml) coconut milk
2 tablespoons (40 ml) ghee or oil
11/4 teaspoons (6 ml) kalonji seeds
1/4 teaspoon (1 ml) yellow asafoetida powder
1 teaspoon (5 ml) fresh lemon or lime juice

1. Wash and drain the split peas. Soak in cold water for 5 hours. 

2. Boil the ginger, chili, water, turmeric, coriander, and split peas in a heavy 3-litre/quart 
saucepan over moderate heat. Simmer for about 50 minutes or until the dal is soft . Stir 
occasionally.

3. Add the chopped spinach to the dal. When the spinach is soft and the dal is smooth, 
add the salt and coconut milk and return the soup to a simmer.

4. Prepare the final zesty seasoning as follows: heat the ghee or oil in a small pan. Saute 
the kalonji seeds in the hot ghee for 1 minute. Saute the asafoetida momentarily. Add the 
spices to the soup, mix well, and allow the spices to blend for a few minutes. Add fresh 
lemon or lime juice. Serve hot.
