<span class="h2">Vegetarian Cooking Classes:</span><br>
<span class="h1">now featuring a lot of people</span>

<p>First, the vegetarian cooking class is in the Kimmel Center, room 805 at 7:00pm every Monday night.  If you join the <a href="list.html">e-mail list</a>, you will get reminders of the classes, and also be informed if they are cancelled.</p>

<p><b>What should I bring to the class?</b> Defintely not pants.  In the spirit of sustainability, we encourage everyone to bring their own forks and reusable plates/Tupperware, but disposable versions of both of those are provided.  Many people also write the recipes down, so if you want to do that, add a pencil and some paper to your list of stuff to bring.  Also, an open mind and a smile.</p>

<p>The class is in the form of a demo - We usually go through all the steps of making a simple vegetarian dish that takes 10-20 minutes to prepare and cook.  While the food is cooking, there is usually a short presentation on one <a href="links.html">positive aspect</a> of vegetarianism.  After the food is done, we all eat together while listening to traditional Indian music and have a good time.</p>
