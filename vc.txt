Vegetarian Chili

This nourishing combination of beans and vegetables is given an extra protein boost with the addition of crumbled 
home-made curd cheese (panir). To make this a dairy-free dish, add frozen tofu that's been thawed and crumbled 
instead of the curd cheese. (Instructions for preparing tofu in this way are included in the recipe for Vegetarian 
Stroganoff). Chili is delicious served with your choice of breads or rice.
