Spinach, Tomato, Eggplant, and Chickpea Stew

This well-known and succulent vegetable combination from North India is a popular 
addition to many Hare Krishna Sunday Feast menus. Cooked until the spinach softens, it 
is a textured, juicy dish. If you prefer a puree like dish, cook it further until the spinach 
and eggplant cook right down. Either way, it's delicious served with Puffed Fried Breads  
or Lemon Rice.

YIELD: enough for 6 to 8 persons

1/4 cup (60 ml) ghee or oil
1 tablespoon (20 ml) minced fresh ginger
2 hot green chilies, seeded and minced
1 teaspoon (5 ml) cumin seed
1/2 teaspoon (2 ml) black mustard seeds
10 dried curry leaves
1/4 teaspoon (1 ml) yellow asafoetida powder
1 medium eggplant washed and cut into 1.25 cm (1/2-inch) cubes
4 medium tomatoes, peeled and cut into 1.25 cm (1/2-inch) cubes
450 g (1 pound) fresh spinach, washed and roughly chopped
1 teaspoon (5 ml) turmeric
11/2 teaspoons (7 ml) salt
2 cups (500 ml) chickpeas, cooked and drained
11/2 teaspoons (7 ml) brown sugar
1 teaspoon (5 ml) fresh lemon juice

1. Heat the ghee or oil in a heavy 4-litre/quart saucepan or large wok over moderate heat. 
When the ghee is hot, add the ginger, chilies, cumin seeds, and mustard seeds. When the 
mustard seeds crackle, add the curry leaves, asafoetida powder, and eggplant cubes. Stir-
fry the eggplant for 8 to 10 minutes or until the eggplant is a little softened.

2. Stir in the tomatoes, spinach, turmeric, and salt. Partially cover and reduce the heat to 
moderately low. Cook until the eggplant is soft and the spinach is reduced in size, stirring 
when required. Add the cooked chickpeas and cook for another 5 minutes. If you would 
like the dish to be moist and textured, add the sugar and lemon juice now. Otherwise, 
cook until the vegetables become puree-like. Remove from the heat and serve hot.
